# ✨ Welcome to My Portfolio


Hey there 👋! This is my personal portfolio built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Motion**, **TypeScript**, and powered by **Bun** for lightning-fast development.

Take a look around and see what I’ve been working on. Below you’ll find instructions to get up and run this project.


## 🚀 Getting Started

To start the development server, make sure you have **Bun** installed. Then simply run:

```bash
bun dev
```

Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site.
You can start editing the files and see your changes reflected in real-time. 🔁


## 🛠️ Build & Run in Production

To create an optimized production build, use:

```bash
bun build
```

Then, start the server using:

```bash
bun start
```

This will run the compiled project with blazing speed. ⚡
